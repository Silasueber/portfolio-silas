                I&rsquo;m a frontend-leaning fullstack developer with a passion for building intuitive, real-time web applications. I recently completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Hamburg and have already gained hands-on experience working for companies like Airbus, Hermes, and Fraunhofer CML.

                My interests lie at the intersection of user experience, frontend architecture, and creative product design â€” I enjoy taking an idea from sketch to scalable deployment. I&rsquo;m especially motivated by projects that blend performance, interactivity, and clean design.

                I live with my girlfriend in Munich, Germany. Outside of work and code, I enjoy running, lifting at the gym, playing Badminton, sewing my own clothes, and trying to win the local pub quiz (never happened yet).
