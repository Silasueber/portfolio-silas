## 🧠 About Me

I'm a developer with a background in logistics, AI, and product-oriented teams. I’ve worked with companies like **Airbus**, **Hermes**, and **Fraunhofer CML**, gaining experience in both agile workflows and large-scale systems. I recently completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Hamburg.

Outside of coding, I’m into **running**, **badminton** and **sewing**.
